# Stellaru
Stellaru is a data visualization suite for the game Stellaris. It is meant to be run alongside the game and provides realtime snapshots and historical data from the game. It works by monitoring and parsing the autosaves while you play. The historical data is saved in raw json files inside of the folder of the game save that is being monitored. It currently only works on Windows for single player games or multiplayer games for the host only.

## Visualizations
Each visualization has both a snapshot view as well as a time series view. Supported visualizations and metrics planned are:
1. Spending/Income breakdown per resource with many drilldowns
2. Number of construction queues and utilization
3. Fleet count, size, and strength
4. Owned planet count, average and total sizes
5. Number of pops, as well as species and job drilldowns
6. Army count, type breakdown, and total strength. Maybe will add concentration as well
7. Science output and breakdown and the total number of completed and available techs
8. Unity output and tradition/ascension perk counts
9. Number of active wars, both galactic total and those being participated in
10. Federation membership, member count, level, cohesion
11. Leader count and type breakdown
12. Number of surveyed systems and owned systems
13. Starbase count
14. Tech, economy, military power, and victory rank
15. Total number of empires
16. Number of active edicts
